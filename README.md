# AzCopy-Runbook

This is the main readme for the AzCopy-Runbook project.

## Overview

This project is intended to serve two purposes:

1. A reference implementation that demonstrates the creation of the
Azure resources needed to support an automation hybrid worker runbook
using Terraform and an AzDO pipeline.
2. A cloud based azcopy "utility" that can be used to perform a
performant/high scale azcopy operation in the cloud.
